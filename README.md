Explanation of the Code:

read_docx(): Reads .docx files and extracts the text.

preprocess_text(): Preprocesses the text by tokenizing, lemmatizing, and removing stopwords.

vectorize_documents(): Converts the documents into TF-IDF vectors for clustering.

cluster_documents(): Uses K-means to cluster the documents.

remove_redundancy(): Removes redundant text based on cosine similarity between sentences.

save_docx(): Saves the consolidated document as a .docx file.

process_documents(): Manages the entire flow from reading documents, clustering them, removing redundancies, and saving the output.

1. Gather Input Files
Task: Collect at least 50 .docx files containing information related to the technology and pharma industries. You can get articles, blogs, and other online documents.
Tip: Use online tools or websites that allow you to download articles as .docx files. For example, you might convert web pages to .docx format using Python packages like requests and BeautifulSoup to scrape content, and python-docx to save them.
2. Clustering Documents Using NLP
Objective: Cluster documents based on their content, so that similar documents are grouped together.
Libraries/Tools:
sklearn (Scikit-learn): This library provides clustering algorithms like K-Means or DBSCAN that can help group documents based on their textual content.
spaCy or nltk: To preprocess the text by tokenizing, removing stopwords, stemming/lemmatizing, and creating word vectors for document comparison.
TF-IDF or Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT): Convert the documents into numerical representations that can be used for clustering.
TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): To represent the documents as vectors based on the frequency of terms in each document and their importance across the entire corpus.
Embeddings: If you need more semantic understanding, pre-trained models like BERT (using transformers library) or Word2Vec (using gensim) can be used for more sophisticated document vectorization.
Steps:
Preprocess text documents (cleaning, tokenizing).
Convert documents into a suitable format (like TF-IDF vectors).
Use clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means) to group similar documents.
3. Eliminating Redundant Information
Objective: Within each cluster, remove duplicate or similar content, and ensure that only unique and relevant information remains.
Libraries/Tools:
spacy or nltk: For text similarity checking, tokenizing, removing stop words, and comparing sentence-level or document-level similarity using cosine similarity.
dedupe: A Python library that can identify duplicate documents based on text similarity.
sentence-transformers: This is useful for measuring the semantic similarity between two pieces of text and can be used to detect redundancy at a document level.
Steps:
Compute similarity between sentences and paragraphs in each cluster.
Identify and remove duplicates or nearly identical text.
Ensure that the output maintains the unique information.
4. Consolidating Documents
Objective: After removing redundancy, consolidate the documents in each cluster into a single .docx file.
Libraries/Tools:
python-docx: This library can be used to create, read, and modify .docx files.
Pandas or numpy: To help structure the content and create the output efficiently.
Steps:
Combine all unique information from each cluster into a single document.
Format the document neatly (e.g., using headings, paragraphs, etc.).
5. Saving the Output with a Descriptive Filename
Objective: Save the consolidated document with a meaningful name that reflects the content.
Steps:
Once the document is consolidated, save it with a filename that reflects the cluster's theme, like Apple_Consolidated_Output.docx.
6. Evaluating the Results
Objective: Ensure that the consolidation process has removed redundancies and that the output is coherent and well-organized.
Steps:
Compare input and output documents to ensure no important information is lost.
Check for redundancies, repetition, and coherence in the output.
Assess if the output document is well-structured and easy to navigate.
